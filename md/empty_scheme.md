# The empty scheme

The empty scheme is the spectrum of the zero ring: \\(\emptyset\_{\textrm{sch}} = \spec 0\\).  In particular, it is affine and it corresponds to the ring 0.  Note that the ring 0 is a commutative ring with 1.  In fact, it is the only ring in which the multiplicative identity (1) coincides with the additive identity (0).

Actually, the only scheme with no points is \\(\spec 0\\).  This statement is equivalent to the statement that every non-zero commutative ring with 1 has a prime ideal, which in turn is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (whether or not you accept the Axiom of Choice is a matter of personal preference: I try to explicitly flag when I am using it, if I realize it!).
