# Glossary of Schemes

<H3>Everything I always wanted to know about scheme but was afraid to ask</H3>

In mathematical writing, the standard practice is to present results in a concise and precise manner.

For an **expert**, this is of course desirable.  The intended target is an audience of readers who knows the topic well, is aware of the difficulties and can see through the remote reasons why some definition requires some condition, where a lemma provides a desirable consequence, how a theorem improves on known results.  Also, a direct argument, going in as straight a line as possible from the hypotheses to the conclusions, simplifies the process of checking for correctness.

For a **beginner**, though, this approach can be hard to penetrate.  Beautiful ideas can be lost in a sea of technicalities, important differences may go unnoticed, immaterial conditions may unduly appear to play a fundamental role.

These pages are my attempt at explaining my perspective on notions of algebraic geometry.  I make no claim of consistency, rigor, directness or completeness.  I am hoping that they will be useful both to someone who is learning the precise definitions and would like some guidance, as well as to someone who wants to have a superficial understanding of the underlying ideas, to grasp an analogy, a concept, the importance of a result.

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, I would be delighted to hear about it!  Please, do contact me at <adomani@gmail.com> or leave a comment!
